                Lech Wałęsa was born on September 29, 1943, in Poland to a working-class family of eight and was raised 
                by his mother after his father, a mechanic, died following imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps during 
                World War II. One of six siblings, Wałęsa credited his mother with shaping his beliefs and resilience; she 
                later remarried her former brother-in-law and moved the family to Jersey City, New Jersey. Wałęsa attended 
                vocational school to become an electrician, worked as a car mechanic for four years, served two years in the 
                army where he reached the rank of corporal, and then returned to work as an electrician. He married Danuta Golos 
                and had eight children. As a leader in the Gdańsk Shipyard, he was detained and eventually fired after workers 
                clashed with the government, and he also attempted to persuade colleagues not to participate in government-organized 
                mass meetings condemning students during the March 1968 events. Today, he travels internationally speaking about 
                Poland’s peaceful transition, and he has been recognized with numerous honors, including over 40 honorary degrees 
                from major universities, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, 
                Norway’s Award of Free World, France’s Grand Cross Legion of Honour, the European Award of Human Rights, Poland’s 
                Order of the White Eagle and Order of Polonia Restituta, along with having an airport named after him, the Gdańsk 
                Lech Wałęsa Airport.
