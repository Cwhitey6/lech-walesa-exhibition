            <h2>Accusations and Archives</h2>
            <p>
                Lech Wałęsa was accused in the 1970s of working with the communists as an informant under 
                the codename “Bolek,” relaying information about Poland, though he denied all allegations 
                and the original charges were dropped in 2000. The scandal resurfaced in 2016 when the widow 
                of General Czesław Kiszczak attempted to sell documents to the Polish government that were 
                said to contain hundreds of notes written by “Bolek,” including reports on events in Poland 
                and meetings with secret police members, dating from 1970–1976, before Wałęsa formed Solidarity 
                and became president; the papers were seized that same night. In later years Wałęsa admitted he 
                agreed to certain circumstances but claimed he never intended to follow through, yet he was 
                charged in 2021 with lying under oath about signing the documents, and in 2023 the National 
                Institute of Remembrance announced a trial for his false 2016 testimony, which remains ongoing 
                as of 2025. He also faced separate accusations of hate speech in 2013 for remarks concerning the 
                gay rights movement.

                Archival files, expert reports, and court rulings all form part of the 
                contested record around these accusations.
