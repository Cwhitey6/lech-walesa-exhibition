            <h2>Beyond Poland</h2>
            <p>
                Lech Wałęsa’s current mission centers on international and interpersonal solidarity, 
                giving talks and lectures worldwide including his “Grand Lecture Tour: An Evening with 
                President Lech Wałęsa” where he visits 28 cities across the USA and Canada to share his 
                views on democracy, freedom, human rights, peace, leadership, the Solidarity movement, the 
                fall of communism, Russia and Ukraine, and “new solutions for a new world.” His website features 
                his projects and the work of the non-political, non-governmental, non-profit Lech Wałęsa Institute 
                Foundation, which conducts historical research on his role in Solidarity and Poland’s political transition, 
                promotes knowledge about Poland’s road to freedom, educates youth on democracy and peace, advances Poland’s 
                democratic example internationally, and supports ecological initiatives aligned with his idea of “the Solidarity 
                of the 21st Century.” The Institute’s projects include training ten Tajik journalists, donating equipment to Tajikistan, 
                running a multi-day journalism workshop in Yangon, and advising Cuban opposition leaders. Wałęsa also founded the Lech 
                Wałęsa Award, recognizing those who courageously promote peaceful global development and political change, and the 
                “Lech Wałęsa Media Award,” honoring journalists and media who foster a positive image of Poland and share its history, 
                culture, and contemporary life.
