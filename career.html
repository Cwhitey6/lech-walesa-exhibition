            <h2>From Trade Unionist to President</h2>
            <p>
                From 1980 to 1989, Lech Wałęsa emerged as the leader of the Gdańsk shipyard strikes, 
                heading the strike committee and negotiating the Gdańsk Agreement, which created Solidarity, 
                the first free trade union in the Eastern Bloc before being elected its national chairman in 1981. 
                Though arrested during martial law, he continued guiding the movement underground and later served 
                as the key opposition negotiator in the 1989 Round Table Talks. Between 1989 and 1991, Wałęsa 
                helped secure the semi-free elections that ended communist rule, played a central role in forming 
                the bloc’s first non-communist government, used his Nobel Prize to apply diplomatic pressure, and 
                pushed for rapid democratic and economic reforms that aligned Poland more closely with the West. 
                Elected president in 1990 in Poland’s first direct presidential vote, he advocated for integration 
                with NATO and Western Europe, but his presidency struggled with unstable governments, and he ultimately 
                lost re-election in 1995 due to waning popularity and internal divisions.
